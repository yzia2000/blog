Hustler is a CLI based productivity management application that builds on a simple
todo list to add features like different task types: events, deadlines, recurring
tasks and tags for storing your tasks and assignments in an organized manner
as well as features to assist in completing tasks efficiently like adding
a timer and a recommended schedule for when you start working. Lastly, it also
motivates you to finish tasks by adding a gamified experience in the form of
avatars, levels, points, a shop where you can buy equipments for your avatar and an achievements
section. Your avatar grows with your productivity!

I was the project lead of this application and designed the architecture, organized
sprints, worked on the task completion feature and successfully merged 43 commits of my own.
I also reviewed and merged PRs from other members of the core dev team and supervised
and contributed to the user and deverloper guide for this project.
