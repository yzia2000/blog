With the current movement from an offline to a digital ecosystem, Zoom, MS Teams
and Skype have filled the void of video communication especially for enterprise
collaboration. However, the open source general purpose video conferencing market
is yet to catch up. The existing solutions either have propreitary backend or
are too complicated to make contributions to. This means that if I had a feature
proposal or software patch, I will have to go through a lot of trouble and delay
to get it merged to production.

## ZiMS-GP
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/zims-colab.png" | relative_url }})
This is where ZiMS-GP comes in. ZiMS-GP is a proposed community maintained project that uses
browser based WebRTC in a mesh topology with Firebase Cloud Firestore for signalling
and Firebase Hosting for cost-effective deployment. It optimizes on cost and quality
for ~5 person party calls. 

## Features
ZiMS-GP currently supports the following video conferencing features:
1. Video room - Create multi-party video chat rooms
2. Audio and video mute
3. Grid layout
4. Screen sharing with screen sharing layout
5. Link invites
6. Browser Interop for iOS Safari and most WebRTC compatible browsers for Android,
MacOS, Windows and Linux.
It is also actively looking for maintainers to implement features like Text
Chat, Push Notifications amongst others.

## Community
ZiMS-GP welcomes all sorts of forks, PRs and feature requests. The vision behind
the project is that if developers want a feature to be implemented in ZiMS they
will get full community support and zero delay in getting it implemented. Its a project of
the community, by the community and for the community.
