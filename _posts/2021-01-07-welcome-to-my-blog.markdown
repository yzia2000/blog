Hi, it's great seeing you here on yet another beautiful day of 2021. This blog
is all about ideas and discoveries in the realm of life and Software
Engineering which I created as a part of my new years resolution to have
a better social media presence.

Some of the projects that I
am currently working on include ZiMS, a video conferencing web app for education,
NUSColab, a web app for colaborative peer review and other web development projects
which will be mentioned here soon.

This blog will also be flooded with
open-source tools for software development like neovim and its plethora of plugins
and Linux configurations because I am addicted to that content. 
Windows users please bear with me. 

Along with my new years resolution package comes a promise to twitch stream
every other day so I would really appreciate it if you could take the time to
follow my [twitch account](https://www.twitch.tv/masteryoushi1234).

I hope you enjoy the content I produce!
