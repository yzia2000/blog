I have always been a huge advocate of taking politics away from Engineering as
it could significantly hamper innovation and lower collaboration due to
conflict of opinion. However, in light of circumstances seen in the US and
countries all across the world, I think it is important to take a stance to
purge destructive and immoral ideas like racism and sexism.

Now I understand the argument behind the fact that having a development branch
in a Software Project named master has become more of a convention than serve
the purpose to incite racism.  However, it is not the name but the idea of
having systemic conventions after deplorable pieces of history is what has led
the world to have systemic racism and sexism.

As of 14 January 2021, I am going to begin transitioning the master branch to
main on all of my 43 repositories and will proceed to follow this new
convetion.

I don't believe in holding a radically progressive or conservative stance, but
I hope this transition will force me to notice some of the elements in the
society that I was previously blind to.

I don't expect others to follow and doing this doesn't make me morally superior
to anybody but I do believe this is a small and easy change that can be made
along with other small and easy changes in areas that matter like education,
health and generally improving the quality of life of human existence.
