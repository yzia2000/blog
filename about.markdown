Hi, this is Yousuf! I am a computerphile majoring in Computer Engineering and
minoring in Data Engineering at the National University of Singapore. I came across
programming at the age of 12 when I got my first laptop, a Macbook Pro,
my first language being Objective-C to make iOS applications. This was followed
by an on and off interest in Software Development until I was 18 when I finally
decided to professionally pursue it. 

As a Computer Engineering student I studied both Software Engineering and
Hardware Embedded Design. Some of my course projects include creating a
productivity app in Java by the name of Hustler, a collaborative documentation 
peer review web app for schools and universities, a 5-stage pipelined Arm7
processor using Xilinx FPGA along with a Neural Network inference hardware
accelerator using array ram partitioning. I have finally decided to settle on
Software Engineering with the goal of creating scalable applications in various
fields as well as contribute to open-source software on the side.

This blog highlights the various challenges and learning experiences in my 
journey towards getting better at Software Development. If you benefit from
my failures or successes, it would be a wonderful accomplishment for me.
